## chat app description

A chat application that offers a extra layer of choice for users when reading their own messages. On login the user will have the choice of opening their message/s OR filtering the message/s to check for words that may offend them. If the user decides to filter they can then read their messages but with offensive words replaced with other words.

### First project simple as - yeah right!

### Learning objectives

* File system set-up
* Terminal commands
* Keyboard shortcuts

* More efficient js code eg: using ternary operators.
* Minimizing js file size for faster load time.
* Use real data.

### Glossary of npm modules, js concepts and technologies....(Not sure what npm's I am using an d this can be removed from README).

* Eslint standard eslint-airbub-config - a tool for identifying and reporting on patterns found in
ECMAScript/js code. Lets you know that you have semantic/syntax errors - that I know for sure. Can set rules for the programmer (standards to follow) in the config.

* Cheerio - implementation of jQuery designed for the server
* fs - file system read and write
* Hyperscript - rendering html to the web page
* JSON - data interchange format. Collection of name/value pairs or an ordered list of values like an array

* Supertest - superagent driven library for testing HTTP servers
* Tape - test harness for node and browsers.
* Tap--spec - formatted TAP output (colors output)
* Promises - represents the eventual result of asynchronous operations
* Slush-pages - a slush generator for static pages using browserify & jQuery.
